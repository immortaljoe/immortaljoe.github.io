#How to create post

* Clone the repository.

* Create a file in the _posts directory and name it according to the following format: ```YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP```. Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and MARKUP is the file extension representing the format used in the file. For example, the following are examples of valid post filenames: `2011-12-31-new-years-eve-is-awesome.md `,`2012-09-12-how-to-write-a-blog.textile`.
