title: Brief Marketing Research
---

Our idea is to develop drones that could be considered as an intelligent housekeeper. In this project, I am responsible for the marketing research. Based on the analysis we extracted from the online resources, we found several companies has developed the similar products. But the majority of the products just focus on the basic functions (e.g. photographing) and modern design. We have found several online resource to make a brief market research of drones.

As shown above, there is the table which makes the comparison between the different popular drones product. We can see that the majority of the drones could only last 25 minutes. That means they will be charged more frequently. Beside of this, seldom of them has the function for the flight planning. For our product, the artificial intelligence will be more efficient to automatically set the flight route. None of these models provide the intelligent control. Furthermore, they haven't designed any interfaces that could be compatible with other external things or devices.

Another important thing is the App. From the table, we could see that only three of them have the App that could be controlled through the mobile devices. Rest of them are more relied on the physical controller. Compared with the conventional way for the controlling, we think that the App could provide a more user-friendly way for different types of users. 

For the battery, the majority of the products still used the LiPo to power the whole drones. We think we can use the wireless charger to make it more flexible in the house. The solar board could also be embedded onto the drones. This will make possible that the drones could conduct a task for a long time. 

In the support part, we found that the majority of the companies still use the conventional way such as telephone, email. Seldom of them use the online service. We use the Internet to more efficient provide the maintenance service for varies of users. For example, if we want to upgrade the software for the drones. The drones will download the software from the Internet and install automatically.
