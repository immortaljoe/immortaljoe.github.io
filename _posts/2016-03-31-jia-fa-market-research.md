title: Solutions to battery problems

Our idea is to develop drones that could be considered as an intelligent housekeeper. In this project, I am responsible for the marketing research. Based on the analysis we extracted from the online resources, we found several companies has developed the similar products. But the majority of the products just focus on the basic functions (e.g. photographing) and modern design. We have found several online resource to make a brief market research of drones.

Thought initial investigation involving with drones in market, the most crucial constraint on drones is the flying time. The most products have been designed to be powered by lithium battery. We have compared several top products in terms of battery life. Most products can only keep flying in the air for 10-15 minutes or even less. Only a few products can stay in the air for 25 minutes. The battery life seems far less than what customers are expecting. Many missions require drones to fly longer to record sensational events such as wedding party or anniversary celebration.

To address this concern, we have proposed three new solutions. First of all, the solar board is a great alternative, as it is sustainable power that transfers sunlights into energy. The strengths of using solar board are visible and outstanding. However, the limitations are also highlighted. Considering that some drones could be used inside environment where there are no sunlights here. The solar board will lose ability to charge the drones. In addition, the use of drones with solar power may also be affected the weather when it is used outside. It is very common for weather being cloudy in Australia, especially in winner. As the solar power has huge limitations, it is turned down in our new solution.

We also consider the wireless charger due to convenience. It is highlighted by charging power when it is working in the air. However, it highly relies on surrounding environment. Because public buildings like reinforced concrete structure buildings could block the way that wireless charger works. Moreover, it also limits the distance from drones and wireless charger to guarantee that the charger works normally.

Apart from this, we have found another energy, which calls hydrogen power. A British company specializing in hydrogen power announced that it has created a fuel cell optimized for small drones. Though embedding a hydrogen fuel cell onto a typical battery, the drones can extend flight times from approximately 25 minutes to over one or two hours. Because the unit can be recharged with compressed hydrogen, refuelling a depleted cell can be accomplished in a few minutes, instead of the 40 minutes to an hour it takes to recharge a typical drone battery.
