title: Testing Plan and Initial Idea
---
Testing stage is a significant process to validate the quality of products. As a product testing participator, I am responsible for designing test scenarios and cases for our product. After learning the concept of Jobs-to-be-down, I am starting to consider more aspects than before when I design the testcases. Obviously,functional jobs are the most involved part for products, but testers and managers rarely access into the areas of emotional and social job.These requirements are supposed to take into account.Testcases covering as more aspects are able to ensure greater quality.

Testing plan should based on these jobs as criteria to design testcases.Functional jobs as primary system features are able to match the demands of functional requirement,which can be seen as the bottom platform of testing stratigeies.Emotional jobs play as the role as usability to validate whether the product is easy to use.This innitial testing idea is based on the extension of JTBD.

Apart from the above knowledge that inspire the idea of test method, the basic features of drone that we will use should fulfill our requirement. Therefore, testing is better to access into early stages of the development process. The earlier testing performed,the more issues located, which enhances the quality of software.
