title: Survey - Low Power Consumption Tech - Passive Wifi
---
In 2016, students(electrical engineers) at the University of Washington introduced a new wifi technology to solve the Wifi battery drain problem. Since more and more devices are required to collected to the clould, and the running time is limited by the battery capacity. In our project, our proposed drone need to carry devices include: battery, camera, contorl system, wifi model, engine. To get a log running-time, we need to install a big battery, but, with a heavier battery, the engine will consume more battery. Hence, we need to reduce the battery consumption of other models. 

In the proposed [Passive-Wifi](http://passivewifi.cs.washington.edu/),  it is a new type of hardware that used 10,000 times less power than traditional Wifi networking equipment. It is designed for the development of the IoT(Internet of Things).

“This type of technology is really meant to reduce the power consumption of the transmitter to enable IoT devices to send small amounts of data back and forth,” says Valenta.

Applying this Passive-Wifi technology to our drone system will delightly solve the wifi battery problem.
