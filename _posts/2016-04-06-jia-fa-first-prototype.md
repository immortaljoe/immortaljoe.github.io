title: Brief description for first prototype of eHousekeeper
---
After a series of negotiation within our group, we have designed a primary prototype for 'eHousekeeper'. This is the first prototype designed based on our brainstorming and market needs research. The eHousekeeper aims to provide services that could help customers to manage and monitor their home when customers are absent at home. The whole prototype consists of three systems: a. central control system implemented on mobile devices such as phone or tablet; b. monitoring and warning system embedded on a drone; c. executing system embedded on another drone.

The central control system would be an app on mobile device held by customer. The customer could keep controlling of eHousekeeper by sending instructions to monitoring and warning system using central control system.

The monitoring and warning system are centralised on the drone with a couple of sensors. A combination of infrared sensor and vibration sensor is used to guard against theft. There is also a gas sensor that is embedded to detect a potential gas leakage. In addition, a smoke sensor is equipped to detect a possible fire by receiving smoke. When the monitor drone detects a dangerous event at house, it will send a message via network to central control system to ask the host for next action. The host could stop the monitor drone for some reasons or trigger the monitor drone to start preventing action. The preventing action will be executed by executing system as another drone.

Executing drone has missions of preventing house from threats of theft, fire as well as gas explosion. It is centralised with a sort of equipments and tools that can be used in a particular mission. It can trigger an alarm to warn the invaders (thieves) that they have been detected. It also has capacity of carrying forceps to switch off the valve for gas pipelines. The drone also can carry a light fire extinguisher that can be able to put fire off. Executing drone only execute a mission when monitor drone ask it to do. And executing drone does not have any sensors. This means that it cannot act by itself. All the missions executed highly rely on monitor drone by receiving the position, and orientation of the objective, a fire, for example. So the monitor drone gives information such as the path of finding the objective to guide the execute drone.
