title: Problem & Solution
---

Currently the smart home can talk to the door to be open when the host come home. Light can turn on when the security camera detects an intruder. The lights also can be dimmed when a sleep sensor detect everyone in the house is asleep. Smart device is also used with voice system now. Like some voice system in your car, you say "play music" then the music is played.

However, it is still far away from the exception of customers. Although now customers can control some smart device in their smart phone, they are in the different systems. For example, there are home automation system, home security system and other system. It is more convenient for users to control all of them in just one app. And there's another pain point in home security system. There will always be a visual dead angle in security system. So we introduce drone into our system to enhance this part. For a home that is already be decorated， installation of a new smart home system will be very expensive and sometimes users have to deploy their electric circuit. Wireless technology, including wireless control, wireless charging, is introduced here to solved this kind of problem.

So the problems we are addressing are:
* Camera’s visual dead angle
* Painful installation (damage to the decoration)
* Massive management of devices (App control center) 
And the solution is:
* Drone with a camera is introduced to avoid the blind area
* Wireless charge is to minimum the damage to the current decoration
* An app is developed to manage and control the device
