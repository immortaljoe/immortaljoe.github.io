---
A product representing our idea and process requires to present for delivering the concept of secure property. From our point of view, drones equiped with cameras are able to supervise areas where have essential property to look after. This presentation is consisted of several aspects such as motivation, solution, market, jobs, and risks. 

First of all,drones with several cameras are able to take care properties,instead of installing many cameras on the walls or conners of property. Some places are still out of control. Another  problems is that if many cameras are installed, there are many screens representing camera need to be settled, which obviously takes much more space than our product. 
Besides, our product is controlled by the software application which needs a team to develop, thus we also need a software team to develop this software.Additionally, eHouseKeeper requires financial support for the purpose of consistently maintenance including software update, hardware maintenance and employees payment. 
In addition, eHousekeeper delivers cozy environment,wireless technology,user oriented and double check visual angle with limited cameras.All these functions are embedded into our eHousekeeper which solves requirement in the area of property supervision.
Furthermore, the risks of eHousekeeper are unforgettable, alarming us to take more steps for ensuring the development of consistence.From our analysis, the application requires intensive test which our testing is not adequate by far. To improve quality, we also need financial support to improve product.
However, our presentation still has demerits. We still need to improve time control from the process as we spent a larger proportion of time to present our motivations.We should present step by step in regulated time.Beside, some points that we try to deliver are going wrong or misunderstanding in terms of how eHousekeep is used in farm. Therefore, we still consider these questions.
