title: High level Jobs to be done
---

Is the smart home or the home automation system that Zuckerberg mentioned just in the science ction? In fact, it is not that far and already being a reality.Last September, Samsung launched a buhu for its SmartThings connected homesystem. It lets users tie a disparate collection of smart device with sensors intoan "Internet thing" so that customer can control the system by an APP in their smart phone.

Our concept is not only a prototype of a smart home like Sansung or what Amazon have done in the same area with its ALexa voice control system, but also asystem with a more security system. To be more exact, it is a smart home withsmart guards. Because customers not only want a smart to get more convenientbut also need a secure and safe home. So I list a list of possible jobs of my conceptas shown in table below.

|              | Functional Jobs                                                 | Emotional Jobs                         | Social Jobs                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| eHouseKeeper | smart devices work for them automatically when they are at home | let customer feel their home smart     | let people see they have the modernest home |
|              | monitor the whole home whether they are at home or not          | let customer feel their home is secure | let people see they have the safest home    |
|              | handle with emergency probably                                  | let customer feel their home is safe   | a status symbol                             |
